    <p>As usual the SUN rose with the blessings of <em>GOD,</em></p>
    <p>The birds started singing and added their voices to the morning glory.</p>
    <p>The cold breeze started sweeping around that blew my hair.</p>
    <p>Yes, it was my schooling slot.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A warmth morning bell has rung at the SCHOOL,</p>
    <p>Every Students were rushing on to the ground to address a prayer to the MOTHER EARTH.</p>
    <p>'A MOMENT' Gentle shadow penetrated into my body,</p>
    <p>I just peeped insensibly. Wow, it's her.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The moment I gaze at her Beauty,</p>
    <p>I merely clicked her mental image in my mind,</p>
    <p>where I wondered like if she was a missing species of UNSEEN PARADISE.</p>
    <p>The SUN rays made her beauty even more radiant.</p>
    <p>The wind frequently freshened her as if </p>
    <p>the MOTHER EARTH protecting her Daughter.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of a sudden I had a fortune with the Glimpse of her.</p>
    <p>It was so mighty that pierced into MY HEART,</p>
    <p>where it made a porous and firmly embedded.</p>
    <p>I could feel the beauty of LOVE in depth.</p>
    <p>YES, It was my LOVE at first sight.</p>
